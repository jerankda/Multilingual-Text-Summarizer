# Multilingual-Text-Summarizer


This is a simple desktop application that uses the OpenAI API to generate concise summaries of input text, as if you are creating index cards. The application is built with Python and uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface. The summaries can be generated in multiple languages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- OpenAI Python package
- An OpenAI API key

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multilingual-IndexCard-Summarizer.git
    ```

2. Install the OpenAI package.

    ```
    pip install openai
    ```

### Configuration

Replace the placeholder API key in the `main.py` file with your actual OpenAI API key.

    ```python
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, simply execute the `main.py` script:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

This will open the Multilingual Index Card Summarizer application, where you can input text, select an output language, and generate summaries.
